# SokratesAgent

SokratesAgent is an innovative framework designed to enhance system capabilities with each user interaction, utilizing a fully open-source foundation. It builds on the ideas of OS-Copilot but introduces significant architectural and functionality upgrades.

## 🧠 Idea

In a previous iteration, OS-Copilot's agent adapted and improved based on user interactions. SokratesAgent takes this concept further by:

- Using another agent to set tasks instead of relying solely on the user.
- Establishing a global goal: improving the system for the user.
- Replacing proprietary models with open-source alternatives.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The system consists of multiple components to ensure modularity and scalability:

### Agents:
- **Initiator**: Sets the overall strategy and defines improvement goals.
- **Planner**: Breaks down the strategy into actionable tasks.
- **Actor**: Executes the tasks generated by the planner.
- **Critic**: Evaluates results and provides feedback for refinement.

### Tools:
- **Toolbox**: A collection of tools that can be dynamically used by agents.
- **Long-term Memory**: Persistent storage to enhance context awareness over time.

### Main Model:
- **Qwen2.5-Coder**: A local, open-source model enabling advanced coding capabilities.

## 🎉 Demo

A demonstration of SokratesAgent showcases its ability to dynamically improve by leveraging local models and a modular architecture.

## ✅ Current Achievements

- Enhanced OS-Copilot with additional tools, all without external costs (thanks to using a local model).
- Modular agent structure allows for seamless integration and scalability.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- **Visual Language Models (VLM)**: Integrate for processing click-based input.
- **Agent-to-Tool Transition**: Convert agents into subclasses of the `Tool` class, enabling the **Initiator** agent to modify and enhance core agents dynamically.
